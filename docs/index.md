# Worldbuilding Kit

*Write better fiction faster.*

**An effort to help writers focus on creating rich, consistent worlds and compelling stories with the help of World-Driven Fiction Writing.**

## What is World-Driven Fiction Writing?

World-Driven Fiction Writing **flips the script** on traditional storytelling. For decades, many writers jumped straight into writing their stories — worldbuilding was just backstory we developed as needed. World-Driven Fiction Writing changes this: **worldbuilding becomes the foundation**, directly guiding compelling narratives rather than just supporting them.

## Getting Started

- [Installation Guide](installation.md)
- [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)
- [Local Development](local-development.md)

## Core Philosophy

World-Driven Fiction Writing is a structured process that emphasizes:

- **Intent-driven writing** where worldbuilding defines the foundation before the narrative
- **Rich world creation** using structured templates and organizational principles
- **Multi-step refinement** rather than jumping straight into writing
- **Heavy reliance** on advanced AI model capabilities for world consistency and story development

## Writing Phases

| Phase | Focus | Key Activities |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **0-to-1 Writing** ("New Story") | Create from scratch | <ul><li>Start with high-level concepts</li><li>Build world foundations</li><li>Plan story arcs</li><li>Write compelling narratives</li></ul> |
| **Creative Exploration** | Parallel implementations | <ul><li>Explore diverse solutions</li><li>Support multiple technology stacks & architectures</li><li>Experiment with UX patterns</li></ul> |
| **Iterative Enhancement** ("Brownfield") | Brownfield modernization | <ul><li>Add features iteratively</li><li>Modernize legacy systems</li><li>Adapt processes</li></ul> |

## Experimental Goals

Our research and experimentation focus on:

### Technology Independence

- Create applications using diverse technology stacks
- Validate the hypothesis that World-Driven Fiction Writing is a process not tied to specific technologies, programming languages, or frameworks

### Enterprise Constraints

- Demonstrate mission-critical application development
- Incorporate organizational constraints (cloud providers, tech stacks, engineering practices)
- Support enterprise design systems and compliance requirements

### User-Centric Development

- Build applications for different user cohorts and preferences
- Support various development approaches (from vibe-coding to AI-native development)

### Creative & Iterative Processes

- Validate the concept of parallel implementation exploration
- Provide robust iterative feature development workflows
- Extend processes to handle upgrades and modernization tasks
