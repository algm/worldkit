## Subplot Weaving Matrix

<!--
  Track which subplots are active in each chapter. Each chapter should ideally advance 2-3 story threads.
  This ensures subplots don't disappear for too long and the narrative feels layered.
-->

| Chapter | Main Plot | Subplot A: [Name] | Subplot B: [Name] | Subplot C: [Name] | Subplot D: [Name] |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | ✅ Introduce | ✅ Plant seed | - | - | - |
| 2 | ✅ Develop | 🔄 Active | ✅ Introduce | - | - |
| 3 | ✅ Develop | - | 🔄 Active | ✅ Introduce | - |
| 4 | ✅ Escalate | 🔄 Active | 🔄 Active | - | - |
| 5 | ✅ Midpoint | - | - | 🔄 Active | ✅ Introduce |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| [X] | ✅ Climax | ✅ Resolve | ✅ Resolve | ✅ Resolve | ✅ Resolve |

**Legend**:
- ✅ = Active advancement in this chapter
- 🔄 = Mentioned/maintained but not advanced
- \- = Dormant (not present)

**Subplot Balance Check**:
- [ ] No subplot dormant for more than 3-4 consecutive chapters
- [ ] Each chapter advances 2-3 story threads (main + subplots)
- [ ] Subplots don't overwhelm main plot
- [ ] All subplots resolve or intentionally left open by end

## Emotional Beats Map

<!--
  Plan the emotional journey through your story. Each chapter should have a target emotion,
  creating an emotional arc that complements the plot arc. Consecutive chapters should contrast
  emotionally to create rhythm.
-->

| Chapter | Target Emotion | Emotional Arc Within Chapter | Contrast w/ Previous |
|---------|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Curiosity/Unease | Ordinary → Disrupted | N/A (opening) |
| 2 | Fear/Determination | Shock → Resolve to act | ✅ Yes (unease → fear) |
| 3 | Hope | Despair → Small victory | ✅ Yes (fear → hope) |
| 4 | Betrayal | Trust → Revelation | ✅ Yes (hope → betrayal) |
| 5 | Confusion/Doubt | Certainty → Uncertainty | ✅ Yes (pain → doubt) |
| 6 | Anger/Resolve | Acceptance → Fury → Commitment | ✅ Yes (doubt → anger) |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| [Climax] | Terror → Relief/Triumph | Maximum fear → Resolution | Highest stakes |
| [End] | Bittersweet/Hope | Sadness → Acceptance → Peace | From intensity to calm |

**Emotional Pacing Notes**:
- **Breather chapters**: [List chapters that provide emotional relief]
- **Intensity chapters**: [List chapters with highest emotional stakes]
- **Emotional throughline**: [How protagonist's emotions evolve from Ch 1 to end]

**Emotion Check**:
- [ ] Consecutive chapters contrast emotionally (not monotonous)
- [ ] Emotional intensity builds toward climax
- [ ] Breather moments are earned (after high intensity)
- [ ] Target emotions serve story and character arc

## Scene-Sequel Structure Tracking

<!--
  Dwight Swain's Scene-Sequel pattern:
  - SCENE (action): Goal → Conflict → Disaster
  - SEQUEL (reaction): Reaction → Dilemma → Decision
  
  Balance action scenes with reflection sequels. Too much action = exhausting.
  Too much reflection = boring. Typical ratio: 60-70% scenes, 30-40% sequels.
-->

| Chapter | Primary Type | Structure | Function | Action/Reflection Ratio |
|---------|--------------|-----------|----------|-------------------------|
| 1 | SCENE | Goal → Conflict → Disaster | Inciting incident | 70% action / 30% reflection |
| 2 | SEQUEL | Reaction → Dilemma → Decision | Process Ch 1 disaster | 30% action / 70% reflection |
| 3 | SCENE | Goal → Conflict → Disaster | First attempt at solution | 80% action / 20% reflection |
| 4 | SEQUEL | Reaction → Dilemma → Decision | Regroup after failure | 20% action / 80% reflection |
| 5 | SCENE | Goal → Conflict → Disaster | New approach | 75% action / 25% reflection |
| 6 | SCENE | Goal → Conflict → Disaster | Escalation | 85% action / 15% reflection |
| 7 | SEQUEL | Reaction → Dilemma → Decision | Midpoint processing | 40% action / 60% reflection |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| [Climax] | SCENE | Goal → Conflict → Resolution | Final confrontation | 95% action / 5% reflection |
| [End] | SEQUEL | Reaction → New Normal | Process victory/loss | 10% action / 90% reflection |

**Scene-Sequel Balance**:
- **Total Scenes (action)**: [X chapters] (~XX%)
- **Total Sequels (reaction)**: [Y chapters] (~YY%)
- **Ratio**: [Verify 60-70% scenes is maintained]

**Pattern Check**:
- [ ] Scenes and sequels alternate (mostly)
- [ ] After major disasters, sequel follows for processing
- [ ] Multiple scenes in a row justified (rising action, climax)
- [ ] Each sequel ends with DECISION that drives next scene
- [ ] Not too many sequels in a row (bogs down pacing)

**Scene Structure Breakdown**:

**SCENE Pattern** (Action):
1. **Goal**: What character wants in this chapter/scene
2. **Conflict**: Opposition to that goal (person, nature, society, self)
3. **Disaster**: Outcome worse than starting point (drives story forward)

**SEQUEL Pattern** (Reaction):
1. **Reaction**: Emotional response to disaster (visceral, immediate)
2. **Dilemma**: Weighing terrible options (all choices have costs)
3. **Decision**: Choice made → becomes GOAL of next scene

**Example Application**:

**Chapter 3 (SCENE)**:
- **Goal**: Protagonist attempts to steal the artifact
- **Conflict**: Guards, traps, moral qualms
- **Disaster**: Gets artifact but betrays ally doing it

**Chapter 4 (SEQUEL)**:
- **Reaction**: Guilt, fear of consequences, questioning self
- **Dilemma**: Return artifact and face punishment? Keep it and lose integrity?
- **Decision**: Will try to return artifact and make amends → GOAL of Ch 5
