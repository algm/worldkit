  Not all will be used, but having options prevents pulling punches.
-->

**Increasing Complications**:

1. [First level complication - relatively minor]
2. [Second level - slightly worse]
3. [Third level - personal stakes introduced]
4. [Fourth level - relationships threatened]
5. [Fifth level - physical danger]
6. [Sixth level - moral dilemma]
7. [Seventh level - betrayal possibility]
8. [Eighth level - allies endangered]
9. [Ninth level - time pressure increased]
10. [Tenth level - no good choices remain]
11. [Eleventh level - must sacrifice something valued]
12. [Twelfth level - identity threatened]
13. [Thirteenth level - world/community at risk]
14. [Fourteenth level - impossible choice]
15. [Fifteenth level - point of no return]
16. [Sixteenth level - catastrophic failure]
17. [Seventeenth level - total loss]
18. [Eighteenth level - must become what they hate]
19. [Nineteenth level - death of core belief]

**[Additional complications 21-30 if needed]**

**Act II Stakes** (should increase):
- **Personal**: [Higher personal cost than Act I]
- **Relational**: [Relationships more threatened]
- **External**: [Bigger world threat]
- **Clear to Reader**: [Are raised stakes obvious?]

**Act III Stakes** (should be highest):
- **Personal**: [Maximum personal risk]
- **Relational**: [Relationships on the line]
- **External**: [Highest world threat]
- **Ultimate Cost**: [What must be sacrificed to win?]
